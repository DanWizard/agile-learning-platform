<insert the user story process jpeg>


User stories are a type of specification, right?
NO! They’re supposed to serve as a centerpiece for frequent interdisciplinary discussion about how to implement something valuable to the user. This is kind of where the use of stories and the practice of agile need to converge. The basic idea is that instead of working in a sequential (waterfall) way from specification to development to test to release you’re doing all of those things together in small batches. In the next section, we’ll step through how to create stories like a designer, but I’ll close with a few cautionary notes about what to watch out for with your user stories.

Why are most user stories so bad?

Mistaken Belief that Software is Automatically Magic
I know it sounds silly, but you’re probably working with people that implicitly think this to a degree. It’s true- amazing things happen with software. But that software wasn’t automatically magic; someone had to put the magic in it. That someone is you. The next section will show you how to conjure that magic.

We Measure Our Efficiency Locally
To a degree, we all just want to finish our work and go watch Netflix. That’s fine. That’s natural. But, if you want to build great software, you have to want to consistently ask the hard questions of your colleagues and your work about whether what you’re doing is still making sense. Is there a strong, testable case that it’s going to valuable to the user? That’s hard to do consistently. A lot of product managers just slam user stories into JIRA and call it a day. It’s not that hard to run a more thoughtful, disciplined program, but it’s not that easy either. You have to really want it.

No Data
You have to know your user and what’s on their A-list to write good user stories. Without that, you’re just going to be groping at some idea about what the software might do and then spending way more money than you need to to find out if you’re right or not.
