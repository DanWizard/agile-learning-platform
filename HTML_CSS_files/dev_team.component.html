                <h3>What is the Dev Team?</h3>
                <p>The individuals that make up the Development Team are a cross functional group that self-organizes their eforts to delivery a Product Increment at the end of each Sprint. Consider the Development Team to be the engine of the team.</p>
                <p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Responsible for creating and maintaining the Sprint Backlog</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Creates a potentially shippable Product Incrementeach Sprint</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Provides estimates on PBI and (potentially) more granular tasks</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Accepts responsibility for tasks (vs. work assigned to)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Makes commitments to each other</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Updates each other by reviewing progress regularly and aligning work</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Collaborates wiith the Product Owner to mutually understand PBI</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Communicates issues and impediments to the Scrum Master</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>To be successful, the Development Team must:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>contain all necessary skillsets to delivery value for the product</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>be dedicated to the group with which they are working</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>be ready to deliver a stream of value and get continous feedback</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Effective Scrum Teams (PO/SM/DT) have 5 to 9 (7 +/-2) total members</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>PO / SM are not included in Development Team count unless executing Sprint Backlog</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Less than 3 Dev Team members: decreased interaction and productivity gains</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>More than 9 Dev Team members: hard to coordinate and complex for Empirical Process to manage</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Try not to think the development team as a resource but human beings! You would be surprised how often management or other people do this!</p>
                <p>"Self-organization does not mean that workers instead of managers engineer an organization design. It does not mean letting people do whatever they want to do. It means that management commits to guidiing the evolution of behaviours that emerge from the interaction o independent agents instead of specifying in advance what effective behaviour is." - Philip Anderso, The Biology of Business</p>
