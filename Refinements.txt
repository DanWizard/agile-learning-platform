Producto Owner orders items based on up-to-date information

Roster:

Frequency:
Continuous activity

Estimation

Relative Complexity

Compare items relative to each other instead of a vacuum
Estimates aren't based just on effort, they take into account many factors (complexity, risk, unknowns, etc.)
Do not map points to hours!
Measurements do not change or day as time increases
A team's defination of an item they think is a "3" may change. If so, all other estimates would need to change as well!


"Anchoring" is a concept where comments made can affect how teams will estimate particular items, being influenced by statements
Persuasive and Vocal team members can affect estimates!

"Trust me this is something that's REALLY HARD!"
"This thing CLEARLY should be with this other thing"
"Oh, that's EASY it shouldn't take that long"

Velocity
The term "Velocity" is a reference to the total amount of work completed within a Sprint by the Developmen Team, often measured empirically.

Requires stablity to be accurate; avoid changing the team
Not a measure of performance, rather it is used for planning purposes
Helpful to determine how much to take on as well for possible forcasting
