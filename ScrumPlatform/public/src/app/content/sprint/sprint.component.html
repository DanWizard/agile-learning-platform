                <h3>What is a Sprint</h3>
                <p>The heart of Scrum is a time-box called a Sprint. They can range anywhere from 1 to 4 weeks, and should stay consistent to allow teams to settle into a cadence for all of the different events that occur. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.</p>
                <p>No changes are made that would affect the Sprint Goal. Development Team composition remains constant. Quality goals do not decrease as the days progress. Scope may be clarified / re-negotiated as more is learned. Sprint may be cancelled if the Sprint Gal becomes obsolete ( Product Owner). The scope of the teams efforts are protected by this time-box of effort. Timeboxing allows for focused efforts and making educated tradeoff</p>
