What are User Stories in The Scrum approach to agile development?
User stories are intended to help teams and Product Owners focus on the customer by personifying the application and its features. This is done by creating WHO the end-user is, WHAT they want to do, and WHY they want to do it; and teams tell this story from the perspective of the end-user.

Why do teams use User Stories?
They make the development process more efficient by framing the tasks with the end-user in mind. This will reduce time spent on unecessary features that do not benefit the end-user.
