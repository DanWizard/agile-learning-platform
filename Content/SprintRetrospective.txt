 Sprint Retrospective
Retrospective
The sprint retrospective occurs after the sprint and sprint review. The retrospective is a meeting with the dev team and scrum master about how the sprint went.
The team will discuss:
What went well during the sprint
What could be improved 
What the team will commit to improve the next sprint
This meeting will determine what changes need to be made to the processes or definition of “done” for tasks prior to starting the next sprint.
