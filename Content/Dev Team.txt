What is the role of the Dev Team in the SCRUM approach to AGILE development?

The individuals that make up the Development Team are a cross functional group that self-organizes their eforts to delivery a Product Increment at the end of each Sprint.
Consider the Development Team to be the engine of the team.

Responsibilities
Cross functional - Team members may share or change responsibilities
Responsible for creating and maintaining the Sprint Backlog
Creates a potentially shippable Product Incrementeach Sprint
Provides estimates on PBI and (potentially) more granular tasks
Accepts responsibility for tasks (vs. work assigned to)
Makes commitments to each other
Updates each other by reviewing progress regularly and aligning work
Collaborates wiith the Product Owner to mutually understand PBI
Communicates issues and impediments to the Scrum Master

To be successful, the Development Team must:
contain all necessary skillsets to delivery value for the product
be dedicated to the group with which they are working
be ready to deliver a stream of value and get continous feedback

Characteristics
Effective Scrum Teams (PO/SM/DT) have 5 to 9 (7 +/-2) total members
PO / SM are not included in Development Team count unless executing Sprint Backlog
Less than 3 Dev Team members: decreased interaction and productivity gains
More than 9 Dev Team members: hard to coordinate and complex for Empirical Process to manage

Try not to think the development team as a resource but human beings! You would be surprised how often management or other people do this!



"Self-organization does not mean that workers instead of managers engineer an organization design. It does not mean letting people do whatever they want to do. It means that management commits to guidiing the evolution of behaviours that emerge from the interaction o independent agents instead of specifying in advance what effective behaviour is." - Philip Anderso, The Biology of Business
