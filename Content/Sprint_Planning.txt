Sprint Planning
Sprint Planning Meeting
The length of the sprint will dictate how long a sprint planning meeting should take and it is the Scrum Master’s responsibility to keep the meeting on track and within the time limit.
The Sprint Planning meeting is broken down into 2 Parts:
Explanation/discussion of what is going to be achieved and what can be achieved in the sprint time period
Discussion on how to achieve the sprint goal
The Product Owner provides product backlog at the beginning of the meeting and gives an explanation of the objectives and items in the backlog
The dev team will go up and move each item into the sprint from the product backlog. Items moved over should be completed during the sprint
The dev team decides which items can be reasonably completed during the sprint
Each item moved into the sprint column should then be broken down into specific tasks and placed in the Sprint Backlog
Refined product backlog items are important for effective sprints. Any member of the dev team should be able to pick up a task and know exactly what is needed to complete the task and what constitutes “done” for the task.
During the breakdown of each sprint item into sprint backlog tasks the team may call in the product owner or scrum master to get clarification on expectations or further explanation of what an item means.
Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Dev Team need to agree on an overarching goal that will help maintain a cohesiveness.
